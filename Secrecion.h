 * - Extracellular signaling molecules (growth factors, cytokines)
 * - Metabolites (lactate, waste products)
 * - Matrix-degrading enzymes (MMPs)
 * - Oncoproteins that may affect neighboring cells

/**
 * @brief Models how cancer cells secrete substances into and consume substances from their microenvironment
 * @details The Secrecion class encapsulates the secretion and consumption behaviors of 
 * cancer cells, which are critical for:
 * - Tumor microenvironment remodeling (acidification, ECM degradation)
 * - Autocrine/paracrine signaling to promote proliferation and survival
 * - Angiogenesis induction through secretion of pro-angiogenic factors
 * - Immunosuppression through secretion of immunomodulatory factors
 * - Metabolic adaptation through altered consumption patterns
 * 
 * In cancer research, altered secretion profiles are characteristic of various cancer types
 * and can serve as biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and indicators of disease progression.
