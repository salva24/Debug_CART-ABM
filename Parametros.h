 * microenvironment. Cancer cells exhibit altered metabolic responses to hypoxia compared
 * to normal cells, including the activation of HIF-1Î± pathways, metabolic reprogramming,
 * and resistance to hypoxia-induced death. These parameters capture key oxygen thresholds
 * that determine cell fate decisions.
