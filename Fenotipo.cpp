 * @brief Implementation of the cell phenotype class for cancer research
 *
 * @details This file implements the Fenotipo (Phenotype) class, which serves as the central
 * coordinator for all aspects of cell behavior in the cancer simulation. Though minimal in
 * implementation (currently only contains a default constructor), this class is the integration
 * point for all phenotypic components.
 * 
 * In cancer research, this implementation represents the holistic phenotype of a cancer cell,
 * integrating the diverse behaviors and properties that define how a cancer cell functions.
 * The modular design facilitates modeling of phenotypic heterogeneity within tumors and
 * phenotypic plasticity in response to microenvironmental conditions.
 * 
 * Inbound dependencies Fenotipo.h

 * Outbound dependencies None

/**
 * @brief Default constructor for the Fenotipo class
 * @details Creates a phenotype with default values for all components. Each component
 * (ciclo, volumen, geometria, mecanica, secrecion, muerte) is initialized with its own
 * default constructor to create a baseline cancer cell phenotype.
 * 
 * In cancer research, this initialization creates a reference phenotype that can be
 * modified to represent:
 * - Different cancer types (e.g., breast, lung, colorectal)
 * - Different stages of progression (e.g., pre-malignant, invasive, metastatic)
 * - Different therapeutic responses (e.g., sensitive, resistant)
 * - Different microenvironmental adaptations (e.g., hypoxic, acidic, nutrient-deprived)
