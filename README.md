# Cancer Cell Agent Simulation

## Overview

This project is an agent-based model designed to simulate cancer cell behavior within a 3D tissue microenvironment. The model enables researchers to study tumor growth, cell interactions, immune responses, and the effects of microenvironmental factors on cancer progression, with a specific focus on studying heterogeneous tumor-derived organoid response to CAR T-cell therapy.

The simulation is an off-lattice agent-based model where individual cells are modeled as autonomous agents with their own properties, states, and behaviors that interact within a biochemical microenvironment containing various substrates and factors.

## Published Research

This simulation framework has been published in **Scientific Reports** (Nature Portfolio):

This publication describes the application of this agent-based model to study how heterogeneous tumor-derived organoids respond to CAR T-cell therapy, providing insights into the complex interactions between immune cells and tumor microenvironments.

The model builds upon previous research published in **PLOS Computational Biology**:

This earlier work introduced the core concepts of the agent-based model, focusing on tissue regeneration and tumor development in the context of liver regeneration after surgical hepatectomy.

## CAR T-cell Therapy Simulation

This model specifically simulates the interaction between CAR T-cells (Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells) and tumor-derived organoids. Key aspects of this simulation include:

- **T-cell Infiltration**: Modeling how CAR T-cells enter and navigate the tumor microenvironment
- **Target Recognition**: Simulating how CAR T-cells identify and bind to tumor cells
- **Cytotoxic Response**: Replicating the mechanisms by which CAR T-cells induce apoptosis in tumor cells
- **T-cell Exhaustion**: Accounting for the limited capacity of T-cells to repeatedly engage and kill tumor cells
- **Tumor Heterogeneity**: Modeling how varied tumor cell populations respond differently to CAR T-cell therapy

This sophisticated modeling approach provides researchers with a powerful tool to explore the complex dynamics of immunotherapy interventions in heterogeneous tumor environments.

## Building the Project

To build the project:

1. Clone this repository
2. From the project root directory, run:
   ```
   make -f MakefileRo
   ```
3. The executable will be generated in the `build/` directory as `ciclo`

### Build System

- All compiled objects (.o files) are placed in the `build/` directory
- The executable (`ciclo`) is generated in the `build/` directory
- The build directory is automatically created if it doesn't exist
- To clean the build files, run `make -f MakefileRo clean`

## Running a Simulation

To run a simulation:

1. Build the project as described above
2. Run the executable with a parameter file:
   ```
   ./build/ciclo params.ini
   ```
3. The simulation will generate output data based on the parameters specified

### Output Files

The simulation creates output files in a "results" directory (which is created automatically if it doesn't exist):

- `DatosFinales.dat` - Summary data (time, tumor volume, radius, cell counts)
- `Datos_[time].xyz` - Detailed cell state data at specific time points
- `PM1_[time].xml` - VTK visualization data for cells (optional)
- `HM1_[time].xml` - VTK visualization data for microenvironment (optional)

Additionally, the project includes an `/outcomes` folder containing example output files and documentation for visualization and analysis. This folder provides researchers with sample data to understand the expected outputs and demonstrates how to visualize and interpret simulation results graphically.
